## Project Title:

Age based recommendation system using Brainchip Akida (Neuromorphic architecture)

## Project Description:
(Provide a short description of the problem you're addressing)

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are expected to
be part of the future AI portfolio, with heavy investment from
industry and government, e.g. Loihi.While
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures have taken large
strides, few works have targeted SNN hardware efficiency. Our
analysis of SNN baselines shows that at modest spike rates,
SNN implementations exhibit significantly lower efficiency than
accelerators for ANNs. 

## Key Objectives:
•	 Clarify our main goals for using neuromorphic computing Literature Review: Research similar work in neuromorphic architecture, and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to understand current approaches, datasets, and tools. 
•	Select Tools and Libraries: Decide on simulation software (e.g., BindsNET, NEST, or SpiNNaker simulator) and any supporting libraries (e.g., PyTorch) based on compatibility and ease of use.
•	SNN Model Selection: Choose a suitable SNN architecture (e.g., convolutional SNN, recurrent SNN) for gesture recognition.
•	Model Training: Use a framework like BindsNET, which allows for integrating SNN models with conventional neural network training methods.
•	Optimization: Experiment with different SNN parameters (e.g., neuron types, spike thresholds) to optimize for real-time performance.

## Technology Stack:
(List the hardware platform, software tools, language(s), etc. you plan to use)

## Expected Outcomes:
Analyze how different spike-coding schemes, network parameters, and simulator settings affect performance.
