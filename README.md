## Project Title:

Low-Bit Quantization Optimization Experiment and Extending CNN Models on the Hive Platform

## Project Description:
(Provide a short description of the problem you're addressing)

For low-bit quantization optimization experiment, Implement and test quantized convolutional neural networks 
with different bit widths (e.g., int8, int4, int2) to evaluate their performance on the Eyeriss simulator.
Investigate the trade-offs between power consumption, computation speed, and accuracy of quantized models on Eyeriss and demonstrate the impact of quantization on hardware efficiency, also evaluate performance trade-offs, and determine optimal bit-widths.
For the Hive Platform, it can implement and test additional CNN architectures, such as ResNet or MobileNet, 
to evaluate the performance and inference speed of different models to see how well EyerissF can support various deep learning models.

## Key Objectives:
- Evaluate the trade-offs of low-bit quantization on EyerissF in terms of power, speed, and accuracy.
- Implement uniform post-training quantization on EyerissF to find the optimal bit-width for efficient inference.
- Test additional CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet) on EyerissF to assess performance and compatibility.

## Technology Stack:
(List the hardware platform, software tools, language(s), etc. you plan to use)
- Platform: Eyeriss Chip simulator
- Software tools: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- language: Python

## Expected Outcomes:
(Describe what you expect to deliver at the end of the project)
- We expect to successfully evaluate the trade-offs of low-bit quantization on EyerissF, and find the optimal bit-width for efficient inference.
- We expect to implementation and testing of additional CNN architectures, on the Hive platform integrated with EyerissF, and do evaluation.
