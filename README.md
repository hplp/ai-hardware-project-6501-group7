## Project Title:

Neural network training using Neuromorphic Architecture (Spiral Neural Networks)

## Project Description:
(Provide a short description of the problem you're addressing)

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are expected to
be part of the future AI portfolio, with heavy investment from
industry and government, e.g. Loihi.While
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures have taken large
strides, few works have targeted SNN hardware efficiency. Our
analysis of SNN baselines shows that at modest spike rates,
SNN implementations exhibit significantly lower efficiency than
accelerators for ANNs. 

## Key Objectives:
- Evaluate the trade-offs of low-bit quantization on EyerissF in terms of power, speed, and accuracy.
- Implement uniform post-training quantization on EyerissF to find the optimal bit-width for efficient inference.
- Test additional CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet) on EyerissF to assess performance and compatibility.

## Technology Stack:
(List the hardware platform, software tools, language(s), etc. you plan to use)
- Google collab
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Expected Outcomes:
(Describe what you expect to deliver at the end of the project)
- We expect to successfully evaluate the trade-offs of low-bit quantization on EyerissF, and find the optimal bit-width for efficient inference.
- We expect to implementation and testing of additional CNN architectures, on the Hive platform integrated with EyerissF, and do evaluation.
